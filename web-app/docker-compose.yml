# DEPRECATED: This file is no longer used
# Web application services are now integrated into the main docker-compose.yml
# 
# Use these commands instead:
#   make start-with-web    # Start complete infrastructure with web app
#   make web-start         # Start web app only
#   make web-build         # Build web app images
#   make web-status        # Check web app status
#
# Original configuration moved to main docker-compose.yml as:
#   - web-backend service
#   - web-frontend service
